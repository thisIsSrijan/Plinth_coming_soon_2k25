## WorkFlow

### 1. Repository Structure

- The `main` branch will hold the **final production-ready code**.
  - No one will push directly to this branch.
  
- The `dev` branch is where integration of work from both teams happens.
  - All features will be merged into `dev` first.
  - Testing will occur in this branch before merging to `main`.

### 2. Branches for Feature Development

- Each team will work on **feature branches**:
  - `feature/landing-page`
  - `feature/preloader`

- **No one should push to `dev` or `main` directly**. Work in your respective branches and create pull requests when ready for merging.
- **Do not merge on your own.**
